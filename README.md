the {elements} are simply to designate out usable classnames for react.

the total value is derived from the es6 below. if wanted it could be its own js file maybe client-total.js or something. if we nest a clone in the return to the txt file this in itself can be convertrd to a csv file. this is our process of providing our clients with CSV print outs of their content for use elsewhere. Ill explain further past the code block:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
var total = client.map (({billableHours}*{hourlyRate}))
export default;
```
